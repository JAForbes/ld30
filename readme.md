What is a shield?
-----------------

Shield has an angle, strength and a percentage of coverage
All are related to the charge uses to create it

The charge is based on the velocity of the gesture

The shield will block incoming attacks.

A small shield is thicker and will survive more hits
A large shield is thinner and will survive less hits, but greater coverage
