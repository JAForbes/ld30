Thoughts
--------

I want to make a more complete game.

I want to pick an idea that seems easy, becuase they always end up being way harder.
And I want to have a menu for once, and possibly some level of persistence.

Right now I am tossing up between two ideas: An arcade minimal touch shooter, or a top down stealth game.

The arcade minimal touch shooter:

- Easy AI : just floats towards you
- Easy collision: Radial
- Hard: Touch, unfamiliar territory
- Hard: Not everyone has touch, so need mouse controls too
- Easy: Procedural graphics, so an easier pipeline.

The Top Down Stealth Game

- Hard AI : Path finding, identifying vision of AI
- Harder collision: Wall collision, obstaces
- Easy: Can be procedural graphics, and later could become sprites
- Easy: Keyboard controls
- Mechanics: Not exactly sure how the game works.  The point could be to make it to a goal, or to avoid the other player.

For now: I think the touch shooter wins.

I reserve the right to completely change my mind as I go.
