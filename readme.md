What is Charge, and where is it stored?
----------------------------------------------------------

The player has a charge.  The charge is reduced when the player shoots or uses their shield.

The charge recharges back up to the original size of the player.

The charge rate has an inverse relationship to the charge level.  A high charge recharges slowly, a low charge recharges quickly.
