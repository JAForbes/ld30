How do I know when the villager got to the goal.

Create a target for them.  Record the distance from that target.
Assume the village always moves in a straight line and:

	If the villagers distance from their start point is >= to the distance to the target from the original place
	Then in the game object access E('VillagersRescued',stats).rescued++;
