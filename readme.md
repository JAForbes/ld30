What is a shield?
-----------------

Shield has an angle, strength and a percentage of coverage
All are related to the charge uses to create it

The charge is based on the velocity of the gesture

The shield will block incoming attacks.

A small shield is thicker and will survive more hits
A large shield is thinner and will survive less hits, but greater coverage

Do shields expire?  Or only when they get hit?

Can you move the shield with mouse move?  And when it expires gesture inward to recharge it

Don't worry too much about the control scheme

If an enemy hits your shield, it recharges you? and damages your shield
