How does the sytem know who is shooting?  Is it hardcoded?
----------------------------------------------------------

There is only one shooter.  But I guess it depends on who owns the gesture.
If a player owns a gesture, then you know it is them who shoots on gesture

Or you could just give shoot on gesture as a component to any to entity and they will all shoot toward a gesture in unison
Which will probably never be useful but that is cool
